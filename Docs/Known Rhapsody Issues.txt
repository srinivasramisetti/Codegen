Issue 1: reported: Paul Kiningham
June 10, 2003
Found when using V31 of codegen, by moving transitions from one state to another,
by moving source and target to different state, Rhapsody does not know the
target of the transition. So when a report is done no target is given, sometimes.
Codegen 31 reports that the number of states in the config file do not match 
the number in the model. When looking through the model text file, there are 
transitions without targets listed.  To correct this, delete the transition
and redraw it.

An issue was encountered where the text "Target:" is missing from the model text
file where there is a transition with a transition action.  The model text file
contains the transition conditions, the transition action, and the target state name
but does not contain the text "Target:".  Codegen 32 reports that state ... is not
found in the configuration file.  To correct this, delete the transition and redraw it.
