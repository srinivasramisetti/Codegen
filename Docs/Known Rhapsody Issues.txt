July 29,2016
In many of our equipment control projects there are two history_fsm.  The reason
is because of limitation of number of timers.  Paul suggests:
   fsm should support an unlimited number of timers that do not affect the number of bits in the 32 bit input word

Mutual exclusion is messy and add a lot of un-readability to the diagrams
Stateflow (Matlab) provides a way to force the order of evaluation, and that maps
nicely into our fsm_config.c file.   To be investigation is how to notate this
and pass it to the .RTF file

Allow == in addition to = in transition lines
Why?   Rhapsody native generation uses ==

Allow to be command line driven, i.e. from a makefile
Allow build server.
For bonus points figure out how to automate Rhapsody to generate the .rtf file

Description field with missing ActivityFunction - Reports a strange error about
"} state"

Issue 1: reported: Paul Kiningham
June 10, 2003
Found when using V31 of codegen, by moving transitions from one state to another,
by moving source and target to different state, Rhapsody does not know the
target of the transition. So when a report is done no target is given, sometimes.
Codegen 31 reports that the number of states in the config file do not match 
the number in the model. When looking through the model text file, there are 
transitions without targets listed.  To correct this, delete the transition
and redraw it.
   June 15,  2016 - Paul thinks this is really an old Rhapsody issue.  Fixed?  (Not seen in recent history)

January 15, 2004
An issue was encountered where the text "Target:" is missing from the model text
file where there is a transition with a transition action.  The model text file
contains the transition conditions, the transition action, and the target state name
but does not contain the text "Target:".  Codegen 32 reports that state ... is not
found in the configuration file.  To correct this, delete the transition and redraw it.
   June 15, 2016: Likely fixed when generation switched to .rtf file???
